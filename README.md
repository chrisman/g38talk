# g38talk

This is a lightning talk that I'm preparing for the three soon-to-graduate cohords at Galvanize Platte Street. The repo is titled _g38_ talk because it was initially supposed to be for just the one cohort.

## About

Presentation framework: [reveal.js]

Content is plain markdown imported by index.html. To the very small degree that it is needed, custom css is written in /lib/css/custom.css.

To start, `http-server` in the root directory, and `open http://localhost:8080`

## Read online

Note that this is a less good experience than running the slides, because there are pictures and gifs that you'll be missing. Note further that even just reading the slides is a lesser experience than hearing me talk about them, because there are inflections and jokes ~~and my handsome face~~ that you'll be missing.

That said, knock yourself out:

0. [hello] - Placeholder
1. [roadmap] - or, _The Plan_. What are we going to talk about today?
2. [credibility] - Who am I and why am I standing up here talking?
2. [my_background] - My journey through life and into writing software.
2. [your_future] - Job search. How it worked for me and what my advice is for you.
2. [bye] - Thanks for having me!
