## Culture

* it's not a ping-pong table <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* what are your values? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

note:

You're gonna have to do some introspection and some reflection. And only you know what that looks like: go for a run, or get a pen and paper, and do some thinking!

1. What do you need to consume, or be given, in order to thrive?

2. What do you need to _provide_ in order to thrive?

Know that culture is how people treat each other, and what they value in each other. Any asshole can buy a ping-pong table. That's not culture.
