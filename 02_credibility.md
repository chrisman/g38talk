note: 

You can find me online. I'm @chrisbrown on Denver-Devs and usually hang out in #topic-bikes, #topic-vim, and #topic-gaming, because those are my hobbies.

I'm a programmer and a yoga teacher, which are two things I really enjoy doing both on my own, and for others.

Left brain/right brain dominance isn't a real [thing], which is too bad, because it's a very useful metaphor, and a way that I like to think about how these two parts of my life complement each other

note:

OK, that's all nice and good. You're relating to me as a person, and are probably having human emotions right now especially after having looked at my cute dogs.

But what do I _do_?

note:

I'm a software engineer at Skookum, the digital product company with a funny name and the Atari symbol as a logo.

_Skookum_ is Chinook jargon from Pacific Northwest. It's an all purpose word like _cool_ that means brave, strong, good, solid, true.

note:

Bonus slide! The building ran out of coffee while I was here right before capstone week. The mood was palpable.
