# My Background

note: 

My background consists of lots of early exposure, a very little bit of formal education, and gSchool

note:

A picture of me with my first book! \s

Incidentally, a friend of mine in my cohort did have twins right in the middle of the program--god have mercy on his sould--and we got the babies a bunch of nerd stuff including this book. They're starting so young they have a serious leg up on everybody in this room. They will have your jobs.

note:

In the early 70s, My dad--when he wasn't solving crimes with the Mod Squad; look at that perm!--was a computer science student at Ole Miss.

By the time I was born in the early 80s, he had been programming for several years, which means that I had a lot of early exposure to computers and programming both in my own personal timeline, and in the timeline of personal computing in general: not many of my friends had a computer in the home when I was little.

note:

This is the first computer I remember. Windows 3.1. The first version of Windows to ship with Minesweeper, btw.

note:

... and I must have imprinted on it, because I find stuff like this cool as hell. A "modern" OS running on a modern version of DOS. You can download this today, run it in a VM, and experience some retro computing. Play Doom. Write some BASIC.

## ü¶ç [GORILLAS.BAS][gorillas] ü¶ç

note: 

My first "programming" memory was looking through the code of Gorillas, a sample game that shipped with QBasic on Windows 3.1, and which is preserved on archive.org!


<!-- Image: screenshot of google image search for "geocities" //-->
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/img/geocities.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

note:

Time passed and I got into what we might today call "front end". Made some geocities websites, which are--thank buddha--lost to the Void now.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="assets/img/tables.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

note:

And then I went to the University of Alabamarolltide and got shell access to a web server. Wrote a little PHP. In Notepad. FTP-ed it up to a server.

"Design" in the olden days:

* All laybout was done in tables

* border-radius didn't appear in a working draft of the CSS specification until 2005: https://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-css3-background-20050216/
  So rounded corners were drawn by hand and included in the table rows.

note:

I took a C++ class and a COBOL class before dropping out. And that was the extent of my formal training in progamming.

I moved to San Diego to live by the beach for a while...

note: 

... and then Followed A Girl to Denver, where I worked at the public library for a couple years.

This picture is a picture of the media lab/makerspace at the library, where I taught kids basic HTML and CSS, Arduino and Processing. And it was while doing that I felt most jazzed and fired up, and realized I wanted to be doing more of that for _myself_. Which is when I registered for Galvanize Full Stack.

Which brings us full circle, back to the beginning.
