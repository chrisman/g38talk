## The Plan

1. Credibility <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

2. My Background <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

3. Your Future <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

note:

I'm going to talk about three things. 

1. My credibility, which is where I'll introduce myself, tell you a little bit about what I do, and why I think I'm qualified to even stand up here right now.

2. My Background, the story about where I came from and my relationship with technology and programming.

3. Your future. Some of you are going into capstone week--your final projects. And after that, most of you will be looking for a job. I thought you might find it useful or at least interesting to hear what that process was like for me.
